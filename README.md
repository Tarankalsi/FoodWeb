   - Created a new React application using Create React App with typescript using vite.
   - Installed necessary dependencies such as Axios for API calls ,Font Awesome for icons , recoil for state management.

3. **Creating Components**:
   - Develop different components like ProductPage, ProductDetailsPage, Landingpage, HomePage and did routing using react-router-dom
   - Used React Hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`) to handle API requests and manage component state.

4. **Fetching Data**:
   - Implemented an asynchronous function to fetch data from the Open Food Facts API.
   - Managed loading and error states as needed.

5. **Displaying Information**:
   - Structured the UI using Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring a responsive layout.
   - Organized the ingredients list into a two-column format for better readability.

7. **Testing**:
   - Thoroughly tested the application across different devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and functionality.
